# SegmentTree
Implementation of a segment tree to update and query the sum of the nodes in a given range.

Currently, the implementation is used to solve a single problem i.e. the sum of nodes in a given range. I would like to make the solution more general and provide the ability to change constraints while still utilizing the benefits of the segement tree.
